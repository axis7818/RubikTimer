      <strong>SECURITY WARNING!</strong>
      Rubik Timer was built as a school assignment demonstration and does not have secure login/password storage.
      If you want to test it, do not use an email/password that you care for.
   </p>
   <p>
      For example, use "notareal@domain.com" and "password1".
      As soon as I am able, I will be enabling secure login.
